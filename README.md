# CI/CD Pipeline TodoList App

## Workflow Overview

This CI/CD pipeline automates the testing, building, and deployment process of the TodoList application.

### Pipeline Steps

1. **Tests and Coverage** (`Test on Node 18` and `Test on Node lts/*`)

   - Runs unit tests
   - Generates coverage reports
   - Uploads coverage artifacts

2. **Lint** (`Lint code`)

   - Checks code style and quality

3. **Build** (`Build application`)

   - Builds the application
   - Depends on successful tests and lint

4. **Development Deployment** (`Deploy to development`)

   - Deploys to development environment
   - Triggers on feature/\* branches PRs to develop
   - Auto-merges PR if successful

5. **Production Deployment** (`Deploy to production`)
   - Deploys to production environment
   - Triggers when PRs are merged into main

### Branch Protection Rules

- `develop` branch requires:

  - Passing status checks
  - Pull request review
  - Up-to-date branch

- `main` branch requires:
  - Passing status checks
  - Pull request review
  - Up-to-date branch
  - Environment deployment

### How to Re-run Checks
